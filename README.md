# **Anomaly**
After **defeating the ender dragon**, **weird portals start opening** all around you with parts of the end that are being **infected at this very moment**, are you **strong enough** to enter them and **fight back the infection**?

You might find some **rewards** that can help you in your fights along the way.

## **IMPORTANT**
You have to play on **snapshot 23w32a or newer**!

If you install the data pack into an **existing world/server**, you need to **relog/restart once** before everything works!

## **Gameplay loop**
First you have to **defeat the ender dragon**

From then on out, anomaly portals will **appear near you** when you are in the overworld

Enter one of these portals by standing **near it for a few seconds**

Once entered, you will be **transported to an anomaly**, a random dungeon with a random boss and filled with random mobs and random loot

## **What content is there?**
There are currently **2 different dungeons**, a city and floating islands

There are currently **2 different bosses**, go and see them for yourself :)

There are **1.5 new mobs** (one of them can't really be called a mob ^^)

There are **3 helmets, 2 chest pieces, 3 leggings and 3 pairs of boots**, most of them featuring unique **passive effects**

There are **5 custom items**, each with **a unique new ability**


## **I don't want to play, how do I cheat?**
You can **spawn a new anomaly near** you with the following command:
```
/function anomaly:anomaly/place_random
```
You can **give yourself all the new items** with the following command:
```
/function anomaly:_/give_all_loot
```
